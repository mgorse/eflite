- fs.c: Re-open the sound device for each sample, so that multiple consecutive samples of different frequencies will play correctly

01/20/03:
es.c: use unsigned chars for punctuation (see Debian bug 177294)
es.h: expand punctuation array to 256 entries
- Release v0.3.5

05/17/02:
es.c: Check for eof when trying to complete a string

- synthesize: return when an unknown command is encountered, to avoid crashing

05/14/02:

- configure.in, Makefile.in: add check for FLite under the user's home directory, check for -lsocket (for Solaris)

04/30/02:
- tone.c: Add code to use FLite code for audio if EFLITE is defined (so that Solaris can be supported)

  sounds are queued

- Call es_log for notification messages formerly printed to stderr
- Add eflite as a dependency to "make test"
- Move call to s_close() below unlink call to avoid restart hangups

03/25/02:
- Add eflite_test.txt test file, add and document "Make test"
- Have s_close wait for text to be spoken before exiting
- Use _exit instead of exit for seg fault handler to avoid recursion
- Call s_close function when exiting due to all clients dying

03/05/02:

- Add vol parameter to dsp_tone(), lower volume of generated dsp tones
- Add ChangeLog to DISTFILES in Makefile.in
- Minor code and documentation clean-ups
- play(): Remove check for EBADF if audio_open returns fd of -1

assume that a line break following a simple command after a complex command
was part of a complex command
