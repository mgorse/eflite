02/13/03:
Makefile.in: substitute cmu_us_kal for cmu_us_kal16 when passing REGISTER_VOX

02/01/03:
- fs.c: Re-open the sound device for each sample, so that multiple consecutive samples of different frequencies will play correctly

01/20/03:
es.c: use unsigned chars for punctuation (see Debian bug 177294)
es.h: expand punctuation array to 256 entries
- Release v0.3.5

12/22/02:
es.c: Read directly from fd 0 instead of /dev/stdin (/dev/stdin doesn't exist everywhere)

12/07/02:
- Release v0.3.4

10/10/02:
es.c: Avoid dereferencing lang in finish() if it is NULL, thanks to Richard
	Bilson

08/24/02:
tone.c: Fix a bug in generate_tone() that overflowed a buffer and caused crashes

08/18/02:
es.c, fs.c: add support for adjusting volume

07/15/02:
- Release v0.3.3

06/03/02:
- Makefile.in: set --owner root and --group root for make release

05/31/02:
- parse(): bypass all spaces before tokenizing input line

05/27/02:
- Reinstated segfault handler when DEBUG is defined (was removed accidentally)
- Have the child act as the daemon and call daemon() to prevent premature exits
- Log some errors in addition to printing to stderr
- Modified es_log to allow printing to standard error

05/23/02:
- Release v0.3.2

05/21/02:
- fs.c: Set ac_synthpos to 0xffff before creating text thread; causes play to set pas if becoming active before synthesize thread

05/20/02:
- Release v0.3.1
- play:: Use ac[AC_HEAD} rather than ac[0] when opening sound card (fixes crash)

05/17/02:
es.c: Check for eof when trying to complete a string
- fs.c: kludgy fix for race condition in which speech is started, stopped, and started again, and two synthesize threads would exist
- play: check ac[ac_head] rather than ac[0] when checking for samples to play

05/16/02:
- synthesize: return when an unknown command is encountered, to avoid crashing

05/14/02:
- Release v0.3.0 (no changes since 05/02)

05/02/02:
- fs.c: modified synthesize(), play(), and s_synth() so that items sent to threads may have multiple "types" (currently SPEECH and TONE are defined)
- fs.c: Only enable segfault handler if DEBUG is defined, since it causes runaway eflite processes when the daemon crashes
- configure.in, Makefile.in: add check for FLite under the user's home directory, check for -lsocket (for Solaris)

04/30/02:
- tone.c: Add code to use FLite code for audio if EFLITE is defined (so that Solaris can be supported)
- Add support for tone_volume, speaker_tones, and soundcard_tones configuration settings

04/14/02:
- Release v0.2.2
- Adjust rate conversion in es.c to more accurately translate to wpm for FLite
	(now x23/4 instead of x9)
- Add "debug levels" to es_log (define DEBUG=1 or DEBUG=2)

04/13/02:
- (hopefully) fixed bug which could cause text not to be spoken when several
  sounds are queued

03/26/02:
- Call es_log for notification messages formerly printed to stderr
- Add eflite as a dependency to "make test"
- Move call to s_close() below unlink call to avoid restart hangups

03/25/02:
- Add eflite_test.txt test file, add and document "Make test"
- Have s_close wait for text to be spoken before exiting
- Use _exit instead of exit for seg fault handler to avoid recursion
- Call s_close function when exiting due to all clients dying

03/05/02:
- Release v0.2.1
- Add vol parameter to dsp_tone(), lower volume of generated dsp tones
- Add ChangeLog to DISTFILES in Makefile.in
- Minor code and documentation clean-ups
- play(): Remove check for EBADF if audio_open returns fd of -1
- Add (dumb) sig11 handler
- Fix bug (introduced by yesterday's fix) where the parser would incorrectly
assume that a line break following a simple command after a complex command
was part of a complex command

03/04/02:
- Fix bug where multi-line text strings would be truncated [reported by bob@rattlesnake.com]
03/03/02:
- Release v0.2.0
- Add configure.in script

 * Release v0.1.3
 * Work-around for FLite pronouncing "a" as a short a when alone
- Work-around for Emacspeak passing in a directory name as an argument to
EFlite

02/25/02:
Release v0.1.2
- Fix bug that would cause a crash if "language" is not defined in the
configuration file
- Add sections to INSTALL documentation on configuring and testing

02/24/02:
Release v0.1.1
- Parameterize the voice, language, and lexicon libraries in the Makefile and
fs.c.
