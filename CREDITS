There are several people whom I need to thank for making this program
possible.  First and foremost, I must thank Kevin Lenzo, Alan Black,
and anyone else who has been involved with the Festival and Festival
Lite projects.  Without all of their hard work in creating a robust
text-to-speech synthesizer.  Without FLite, EFlite could not exist.
The alsa support and accompanying thread cleanups were done by Lukas
Loehrer.  Several changes were made by Jeremy Huddleston, who also
ported eflite to gentoo.  There are probably others who I am leaving out,
so please let me know if you think I should have included you.
