README for FLite Emacspeak server
        v0.2.0; 03/03/02
========================================================================
This code allows Emacspeak, as well as yasr and potentially Brass, to
interface with the Festival Lite speech synthesizer.  It is currently in
the beta stage and not necessarily well polished (well, neither is its
documentation, for that matter), but it is working for me, although I have
done most of my testing with yasr.  See the file INSTALL for instructions
on compiling eflite and getting it to work with screen readers.

Eflite uses the audio library included with Festival Lite, so it
theoretically inherits ALSA support, although I seem to remember having
trouble getting the ALSA code to compile (it seems that the ALSA API
differs depending on which version is being used).

The source is divided into two parts: a generic parser (es.c and some
helper files) and a file for interfacing with Festival Lite (fs.c).
The interface used by fs.c is borrowed from Roger Butenuth's speech
library used by BRASS (in fact, I used his ViaVoice module as a starting
point to write fs.c).  However, fs.c can be built to link against
es.c directly if STANDALONE is defined (this is done in the Makefile).
There may be legal issues that would arise if fs.c were linked against
libspeech.a from BRASS, since BRASS is GPLed whereas FLite is not,
but I am not sure one way or the other.

Send flames, bug reports, etc. to mgorse@alum.wpi.edu.  You can also
catch me on #blinux on openprojects, as "vortex"
