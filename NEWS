More sensible behaviour for both OSS and Alsa in case of audio problems.

2006-02-17: 

* Works more reliably with flite version that uses alsa for audio
playback. Alsa has some advantages over OSS:
  You can now have auditory icons in emacspeak:

	  (setq emacspeak-play-program "aplay")
	  (setq emacspeak-auditory-icon-function 'emacspeak-play-auditory-icon)
	  (emacspeak-toggle-auditory-icons t)

  With alsa, multiple programs can access the sound device
  simultaneously,  so you can play an mp3 file while eflite is talking.

* For cases where the user wants to read a long piece of thext from
 top to bottom, memory usage has been drastically reduced.

* New command line  option "-c context_name".
 Allows for multiple instances of eflite that do
  not interfere with each other. Useful for testing eflite without
  losing speech.
    Another idea: Important notifications could be issued in a
  separate  context.
